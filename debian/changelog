bats (1.1.0+git104-g1c83a1b-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream snapshot from v1.1.0-104-g1c83a1b 
    - adds --filter argument
  * Needs GNU's (not moreutils) parallel command line tool.
    Added to B-Depends (for tests) and Recommends.
    ATM no proper sensing is done, so parallel runs might fail if there is
    no GNU parallel. See https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core/issues/240

      (thanks Kevin Otte for the initial report)
